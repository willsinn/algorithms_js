// Share
// We are given two sentences s1 and s2.  (A sentence is a string of space separated words.  Each word consists only of lowercase letters.)

// A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

// Return a list of all uncommon words. 

// You may return the list in any order.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: s1 = "this apple is sweet", s2 = "this apple is sour"
// Output: ["sweet","sour"]
// Example 2:

// Input: s1 = "apple apple", s2 = "banana"
// Output: ["banana"]
 

// Note:

// 0 <= s1.length <= 200
// 0 <= s2.length <= 200
// s1 and s2 both contain only spaces and lowercase letters.
