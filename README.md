# Algorithm Notes

- BigO notation: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/big-o-notation-why-it-matters-and-why-it-doesnt-1674cfa8a23c/
- Omega Notation
- For Arrays: adding an element is O(1), removing an element is O(N)

# Algoexpert - most important algorithms to know

1.  ## Depth First Search - Stack - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fujbpJ0LB4

    `Time Complexity` - O(V+E)
    `Best Use Cases` - Count Connected Components, Determine Connectivity, Find Bridges/Articulation Points (Articulation points represent vulnerabilities in a connected network – single points whose failure would split the network into 2 or more components.), Compute a Graph's Minimum Spanning Tree, Check if Graph is Bipartite, Topologically sort nodes of a Graph, Generate Mazes.
    `How it works` - Explore nodes until null cannot re-explore a node that is currently being explored, if either happen - backtrack to a node that can continue exploring.
    `Tricks & Tips` - Mark the nodes traversed as true or with an id.

    # DFS - Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

2.  Breadth First Search - Queue
3.  Matching Parenthesis - Stack
4.  Hash Tables - Fibonacci’s Sequence
5.  How to Manipulate Multiple Pointers - Longest Palindromic Sub-String
6.  Reversing a Linked List - Use 3 Pointers
7.  Sorting Fundamentals - Understand concepts of Merge Sort, Quick Sort (Choose a Pivot - Divide in half), Insertion Sort and know the Runtime (BigO of nLogn)
8.  Recursion - What you’re doing at every iteration & Base Case
9.  Construct Data Structures - construct a Class method (OO programming)
10. Binary Search - Find the CRASH version of an application on GitHub (Logn)
