# Algoexpert - most important algorithms to know

1.  ## Depth First Search - Stack - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fujbpJ0LB4
    `Time Complexity` - O(V+E)
    `Best Use Cases` - Count Connected Components, Determine Connectivity, Find Bridges/Articulation Points (Articulation points represent vulnerabilities in a connected network – single points whose failure would split the network into 2 or more components.), Compute a Graph's Minimum Spanning Tree, Check if Graph is Bipartite, Topologically sort nodes of a Graph, Generate Mazes.
    `How it works` - Explore nodes until null cannot re-explore a node that is currently being explored, if either happen - backtrack to a node that can continue exploring.
    `Tricks & Tips` - Mark the nodes traversed as true or with an id.
2.  Breadth First Search - Queue
3.  Matching Parenthesis - Stack
4.  Hash Tables - Fibonacci’s Sequence
5.  How to Manipulate Multiple Pointers - Longest Palindromic Sub-String
6.  Reversing a Linked List - Use 3 Pointers
7.  Sorting Fundamentals - Understand concepts of Merge Sort, Quick Sort (Choose a Pivot - Divide in half), Insertion Sort and know the Runtime (BigO of nLogn)
8.  Recursion - What you’re doing at every iteration & Base Case
9.  Construct Data Structures - construct a Class method (OO programming)
10. Binary Search - Find the CRASH version of an application on GitHub (Logn)
